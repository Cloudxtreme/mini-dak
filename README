Introduction
============

This is mini-dak a partial and lightweight reimplementation of dak
(Debian Archive Kit/Katie) in shell script and with no database
dependencies, "designed" to host new Debian architectures.

So the main purpose of mini-dak is to run a slave archive for new
Debian ports, taking all sources from the master archive. Sources for
the slave archive are supposed to be modifications and porting fixed
for the new architectures.

Setup
=====

Download the sources, and put them for example in '/srv/ftp.foo.org/bin',
create a user for it (optional), edit archive.conf and run archive-setup.
Install the cronjob. Enjoy.
